        <p class="about">Hello, my name is Ryan! I’m a recent student of the Computer Animation and Web Design program at the Center for Technology, Essex. I’m passionate about art and animation (starting from a young age where I doodled on almost every homework assignment), and I hope to do it for a living. Some of my awards include 1st place at the state level and 4th place at the national level for the SkillsUSA 3D Animation and Visualization competition in 2022. Other achievements include Associate Web Development certification, and the Messiest Desk Award in Mrs. Schroeder’s 3rd Grade Class (circa 2014).</p>
        <p class="about">I was born and raised in Vermont since 2005 and was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease in 2014. One of those things has greatly affected my health, my perspective on life, and my diet. The other is Crohn’s Disease. However, both have helped make me who I am today.
